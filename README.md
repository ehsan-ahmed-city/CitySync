# CitySync
CitySync is a full-stack mobile app that acts as an intelligent student planner that integrates timetable events, coursework and real-time travel planning all together.

The system consists of a React native mobile app that communicates with a Spring Boot backend API

## Features
1. Unified timetable combining device calendar and coursework
2. Real-time travel time estimations using Google Routes API based on arrival times
3. Leave-soon travel notifications based on travel + buffer times
4. Coursework tracking with weightings and grade calculations
5. Email-based authentication with verification codes

## My stack

Backend: Spring Boot Java,PostgreSQL
Mobile: React native (Expo), Typescript
APIs: Google Routes API
Services: GMAIL SMTP (email server)

## Project Structure

Project structure is organised into 2 main components which is a backend API and mobile application.

### Root Directory
CitySync_Schema.sql is a PostgreSQL schema used to initialise the database.

README.md includes the setup instructions and project overview

/backend for Spring Boot API

/mobile for Expo mobile App


### Backend

Spring Boot REST API for decision logic, authentication and external API integration.

#### src/main/java/com/citysync/backend/:

auth/ is for email verification and authentication logic

user/ is for user entity and data access

coursework/ is for coursework management such as CRUD,weightings and logic

module/ is for module management

travel/ is for integration with Google Routes API

src/main/resources/application.properties contains the backend configuration such as database, email and API keys


#### Mobile /mobile

app/ has the main screens using Expo router such as tabs, onboarding

components/ are reusable components such as buttons and cards

lib/ has helper functions such as API calls and travel logic

assets/ has images/icons that come with React

app.json has Expo configurations


## Prerequisites

Node.js

Java 21

PostgreSQL

Expo Go (on your mobile device)

## Database setup

### Create a postgresql database called citysync:

Make sure you're in the root directory where CitySync_Schema.sql is located, before running the import command.

psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE citysync;"

### and then import the schema:

psql -U postgres -d citysync -f CitySync_Schema.sql

### "psql not recognised" error

ig you get an error like : "psql is not recognised as a command"

then this means that PostgreSQL is not added to your system path.

To fix this on windows:

1. Open up: Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin (number is different depending on your version)
2. Copy that path
3. Press the windows button and search for environment variables
4. Edit the "Path" variable on the upper window
5. Add the PostgreSQL bin directory by pasting it
6. Restart powershell

## Setting up environment variables

### Open up powershell before you run the backend and set your environment variables:

$env:GOOGLE_ROUTES_KEY="yourroutes_api_key"

$env:MAIL_USER="you@gmail.com"

$env:MAIL_PASS="your_app_password"


## Setting up google Routes API


To set up the API key:

1. Create a google cloud project
2. You have to setup and enable billing for the project
3. Enable the routes API
4. Create an API key
5. Restrict the key to Routes API only

## Gmail SMTP setup/app password

CitySync uses gmail SMTP for sending emails with verification codes, the backend expects MAIL_USER and MAIL_PASS

### SMTP Config

enable 2FA on your gmail

Generate app password

use it as Mail_PASS in the environment variables step (scroll up)

Host: smtp.gmail.com

port: 587


## Backend setup and run

have the citysync directory open in powershell 

cd backend

### windows
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

### mac
./mvnw spring-boot:run


The backend runs on:

http://localhost:8080

## Mobile setup

Open another powershell window and change directory citysync

cd mobile

npm install

npx expo start

If port 8081 is already in use, expo will prompt that it's being used by another process.

You can press 'Y' to use another port like 8082 and it will run the app normally

## Local config

### Local configuration:

CitySync automatically detects your backend computer LAN IP when running Expo Go.

requirements:
The backend must be running, it's configured to run on port 8080

The mobile device and computer must be on the same wifi network

The app should be launched using "npx expo start" ,then scanning the QR code which opens Expo Go.


## Running the app

Scan QR code with Expo Go

App should load login screen

## CitySync Usage guide
